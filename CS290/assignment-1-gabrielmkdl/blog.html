        <h3> Reflection:</h3>
        <p>
            I think this assignment went pretty well. This was my first time making a website and coding in HTML, but I got the hang of it very quickly. HTML isn't a hard language to learn and I had the examples in GitHub from lectures that helped guide me. I also never used GitHub or git commands before this class, so learning the basics of GitHub and git commands was useful. I spent some time on Git It going through all the modules and used the Ed discussion forum related to Git Hub to help upload my files onto Git Hub.
